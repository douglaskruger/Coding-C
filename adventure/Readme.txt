This is a wonderful tutorial from Ruud Helderman <r.helderman@hccnet.nl>
on how to write an adventure game in 'c'.

I have included on my GitHub only for convenience.

I was able to download the 'src.zip' but had to update the object.awk and map.awk manually as this was not included from Ruud's source zip file but included in his web pages (see the 'Combat' page for the latest object.awk as this file evolves on his demo)
