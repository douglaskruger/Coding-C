	// So this function can accept a variable number of arguments.  No (practically speaking) limits.

	// RULES you must know in order to be able to use "..." in one of your own functions:
	//
	// 1)  The ... MUST appear exactly as ...  It cannot be "..." (with the quotes),
	//     '...', or anything else weird.
	//
	// 2)  The ... __MUST GO LAST__ IN THE ARGUMENT LIST
	//
	// 3)  THERE MUST BE AT LEAST ONE MANDATORY, NON-OPTIONAL ARGUMENT,
	//     THAT COMES BEFORE THE ...

	// We'll be using these macros here:
	// va_list    va_start    va_end    va_arg

	// All of the above va_* things are actually special MACROS, exclusively defined for us to use when 
	// working with _V_ariable _A_rgument lists.

	// FIRST, we create a POINTER that will be used to point to the first element of the VARIABLE
	// ARGUMENT LIST.
	va_list listPointer;

	// Currently, listPointer is UNINITIALIZED, however, now we make listPointer point to
	// the first argument in the list
	va_start( listPointer, numargs );

	// Notice that numargs is the LAST MANDATORY ARGUMENT that the addThemAll() function takes.
	// By "LAST MANDATORY ARGUMENT", I mean 'numargs' is the last argument to the addThemAll() function
	// JUST BEFORE the "..."

	// NEXT, we're going to start to actually retrieve the values from the va_list itself.
	// THERE IS A CATCH HERE.  YOU MUST KNOW THE DATA TYPE OF THE DATA YOU ARE RETRIEVING
	// FROM THE va_list.  In this example, I'm assuming they're all ints, but you could always pass a format
	// string that lets you know the types.

	int sum = 0;
	for( int i = 0 ; i < numargs; i++ )
	{
		// GET an arg.  YOU MUST KNOW THE TYPE OF THE ARG TO RETRIEVE IT FROM THE va_list.
		int arg = va_arg( listPointer, int );
		printf( "    The %dth arg is %d\n", i, arg );
		sum += arg;
	}
	printf("--");
	printf("END OF ARGUMENT LIST\n\n");

	// FINALLY, we clean up by saying va_end().  Don't forget to do this BEFORE the addThemAll() function returns!
	va_end( listPointer );
	printf("The total sum was %d\n\n", sum);
